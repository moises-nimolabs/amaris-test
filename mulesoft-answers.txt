The HTTP Listener is the entry point of the flow. It is configured for incoming HTTP requests on the path /processData.

The DataWeave reads the JSON content from the apiResponse, extracts the 'title' and 'completed' fields, creates a new JSON object
with the Keys processedTitle and isCompleted. 
The expected output is: 
{
  "processedTitle": "delectus aut autem",
  "isCompleted": false
}

The success-code-validator will trigger the error-handler, log the error with the description, the it will set the payload
to the value='{"status": "error", "message": "An error occurred"}', making it the final payload of the flow.

The final payload should be: 

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "processedTitle": "delectus aut autem",
    "isCompleted": false
  }
}

I would change the snippet to:

%dw 2.0
%var apiResponse = read(vars.apiResponse, "application/json")
output application/json
---
{
  processedTitle: upper(apiResponse.title),
  isCompleted: apiResponse.completed
}
